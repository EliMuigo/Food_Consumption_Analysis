> DATA CATEGORIES

**Numerical Data(Quantative)**
contains numerical values and is divided into two:
  - <u>Discrete Numbers</u> are counted as whole they include (no. of pets, no. of packages).
  - <u>Continuous Numbers</u> can be infinite precision include(speed,time,weight,height,temperature).


**Categorical Data(Qualitative)** contains values that cannot be measured up against each other including(zip code,color). Can be divided into two:

  - <u>Nominal Data (Unordered)</u> represents categories without any oreder or ranking example (gender,colors,fruits)

  - <u>Ordinal Data</u> contains categorical data that can be measured against each other and have a meaningful order or ranking for example(school grades where A is better than B)

  > Descriptive Statistics- Focuses on describing and summarizing the data at hand.
  
  >Inferential Statistics- Use sample data to make inferences of a larger population.

  NOTEBETTER:
  Incase of numerical data mean is used and scatter plots are the best.
